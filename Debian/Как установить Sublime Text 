Linux Package Manager Repositories

Sublime Text includes an auto-upgrade mechanism on Windows and Mac 
to make upgrades a snap. Instead of going against the grain of the 
Linux ecosystem, packages and package repositories are provided for most of the major distributions.

Builds listed in the dev channel are only available to licensed users. 
Users who are evaluating Sublime Text before purchase will need to use the stable channel.

    apt — Ubuntu, Debian

    pacman — Arch

    yum — CentOS

    dnf — Fedora

    zypper — openSUSE

apt

The apt repository contains packages for both x86-64 and arm64.

Install the GPG key:

wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/sublimehq-archive.gpg > /dev/null

Select the channel to use:

    Stable

    echo "deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list

    Dev

    echo "deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/dev/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list

Update apt sources and install Sublime Text:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text

If this fails ensure apt is set up to work with https sources:

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
